                <h2 class="heading-large">4. How much you have to spend</h2>
                <p>The amount you have to spend on apprenticeships depends on how much you paid in levy plus a few other calculations </P>
                  <p>We have developed a set of calculators that will help you work out the amount you are likely to have to spend</p>
                  <p><a href="/{% include "includes/sprint-link.html" %}/register/calculate">Calculate the amount you have to spend.</a></p>
                  <p>To work out how much you have to spend we make the following calculations</p>
                  <h2 class="heading-medium">1. The amount of levy you have paid</h2>

                <p class="">The levy will be charged at a rate of 0.5% of an employer’s pay bill. Levy payments will be collected monthly by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) through Pay as You Earn (PAYE), payable alongside tax and National Insurance. Pay bill will be based on total employee earnings subject to Class 1 secondary National Insurance Contributions (NICs).</p>
                <h2 class="heading-medium">2. The £15,000 allowance</h2>
                <p>There will be a £15,000 fixed annual allowance for employers to offset against their levy payment. A connected person rule, similar to the one used for the Employment Allowance, will mean that employers who operated multiple payrolls will only be able to claim one allowance for the levy</p>
                <h2 class="heading-medium">3. English fraction</h2>
                <p>The proportion of payroll for an employer that is directly attributable to their English operations (separate from Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish operations). This will be automatically calculated by HMRC using data on postcode of employee's home address. 
                <p>Calculation will be calculated and published once a year, employers will not have the opportunity to appeal as the calculation will be made based on data submitted by employers. </p>
                <p>New Employers that have not had calculation run yet for that year, HMRC will use 81% until the next calculation run.</p>
                <h2 class="heading-medium">4. Government top up</h2>
                <p>The government will apply a 10% top-up to monthly funds entering levy paying employers digital accounts, for apprenticeship training in England, from April 2017. All funds entering a levy payer’s account will be increased, so every £1 will be increased to £1.10 in value.</p>

                <h2 class="heading-medium">Examples of employer levy funds</h2>
                <h3 class="heading-small">Example 1:</h3>
                <p>Employer of 250 employees, each with a gross salary of £20,000 would pay:</p>
                 <ul class="list list-bullet">
                    <li>Pay bill: 250 x £20,000 = £5,000,000</li>
                    <li>Levy sum: 0.5% x £5,000,000 = £25,000</li>
                  <li>Allowance: £25,000 - £15,000 = £10,000 annual levy payment</li>
                  <li>Payment: £10,000 * 0.8 English Fraction = £8,000</li>
                   <li>SFA funding: £8,000 * 1.1 Top Up = <span style="font-weight:700">£8,800 to spend on apprenticeships</spend></li>
                </ul>  
                <h3 class="heading-small">Example 2:</h3>
                <p>Employer of 100 employees, each with a gross salary of £20,000 would pay:</p>
                 <ul class="list list-bullet">
                    <li>Pay bill: 100 x £20,000 = £2,000,000</li>
                    <li>Levy sum: 0.5% x £2,000,000 = £10,000</li>
                    <li>Allowance: £10,000 - £15,000 = £0 annual levy payment and funds</li>
